    "text": "In this project, we tackle Mini-Challenge 2 of the 2025 IEEE VAST Challenge (VAST Challenge MC2), which provides three JSON‑based knowledge graphs—TROUT (Tourism Raises OceanUs Together), FILAH (Fishing Is Living and Heritage), and an independent journalist dataset—alongside a GeoJSON file oceanus_map.geojson (administrative basemap) and road_map.json (road/travel network). Together, these datasets capture the Commission on Overseeing the Economic Future of Oceanus (COOTEFOO) members’ meeting participation, travel records, and discussion transcripts within their spatial context. By integrating and analyzing these interlinked sources, we will uncover network structures, spatial clustering, and sentiment trends that offer transparent, data‑driven insights into potential bias.\n\n\n\nThe COOTEFOO faces serious accusations of bias from two opposing interest groups: FILAH and TROUT . Journalist Edwina Darling Moray needs robust visual analytics tools to investigate these claims and uncover the truth about potential bias in government oversight. This project addresses a critical need for transparency in government accountability through data-driven journalism.\n\n\n\nPrimary Challenge: Determining whether COOTEFOO members exhibit systematic bias toward fishing or tourism industries based on their meeting participation, travel patterns, and decision-making behaviors.\nSpecific Issues:\n\nIncomplete Data Perspectives: TROUT and FILAH datasets each capture only a subset of COOTEFOO’s engagements, potentially risking skewed conclusions. Reconciling these partial views against a more complete dataset by Journalist Edwina Darling Moray is needed.\nComplex Relationship Analysis: Understanding connections between committee members, organizations, and geographic locations across multiple datasets. We need to surface clusters of members and topics to reveal chambers forming around fishing or tourism interests.\nMulti-dimensional Bias Assessment: Evaluating bias across different types of activities (meetings, travel, voting patterns) will allow us to pinpoint not only whether bias exists but how and where it arises from.\n\n\n\n\nKnowledge Graph Visualization: Techniques such as force-directed layouts and adjacency matrices have proven effective for exploring large entity-relation networks and highlighting community structures and central actors.\nBias Detection in Networks: Network analysis metrics e.g. centrality differences will allow us to detect systemic inclinations in decision-making and group formation.\nComparative Dataset Analysis: Visualising differences between overlapping datasets is critical for us to assess how incomplete group records may distort perceived patterns.\n\n\n\nIn addition to exploratory data analysis on the respective data sets we propose the four complementary visual‐analytics modules below.

    "text": "Oceanus has enjoyed a relatively simple, fishing-based economy for decades. However, in recent times tourism has greatly expanded and resulted in significant changes. The local government set up an oversight board - Commission on Overseeing the Economic Future of Oceanus (COOTEFOO) - to monitor the current economy and advise how to prepare for the future. It is an appointed board that has no direct power on rules/spending BUT has a lot of clout in the civil service and gets government money to do its job…ostensibly in an unbiased way.\nRecently COOTEFOO was hit by a sequence of scandals that roughly break down into two camps:\nFishing is Living and Heritage (FILAH) accuses the board of being biased toward the new tourism economy and inappropriately attending to the potential in those ventures, ignoring the historical powerhouse of the economy: Getting lots of fish out of the water and off to hungry people. They accuse some COOTEFOO members of bias against fishing.\nTourism Raises OceanUs Together (TROUT) accuses the board of being biased toward an entrenched interest and constantly “appeasing” the fishing industry, ignoring the new/growing avenues for economic stability. They accuse some members of ignoring the brave-new-world and living in the past.\nA journalist, Edwina Darling Moray (E.D. to her friends), at the Haacklee Herald is working on a story about government accountability. She has acquired the datasets that TROUT and FILIAH are working from, which includes meeting minutes and travel records of COOTEFOO members. She also has acquired additional records that TROUT and FILAH did not. Moray has employed a staff programmer to massage the data into a consistent format for analysis – a knowledge graph. You are picking up the work from that programmer to design visualizations to support Moray’s understanding of what is going on. Moray is not a knowledge graph expert, but she understands the workings of Oceanus well. She wants you to design a visual interface to explore the accusations in context and discern which are founded and which are spurious."

    "text": "Re-evaluating Teddy Goldstein, the member accused by TROUT\nThe heatmap, configured for Teddy Goldstein, initially shows a tourism score of –0.50 across the TROUT and JOURNALIST dataset.\n\nZooming into the TROUT network reveals negative sentiment links from Goldstein to marine_life_deck and expanding_tourist_wharf reinforcing the impression that he opposes tourism.\n\nThe Activity Summary for marine_life_deck records his reason, “Prefers resources to be allocated toward the fishing industry”.\n\nThe interactive map places marine_life_deck on the south-east coast of the main island, inside a zone shaded blue for fishing activity, confirming that the project would sit in a fishing heartland.\n\n\nAnalysis\nThe sentiment heat-map shows that TROUT and the Journalist dataset both portray Teddy Goldstein as negative towards tourism, yet neutral-to-positive towards fishing. Zooming into the TROUT network view reveals a negative edges target marine_life_deck, a tourism topic. The Activity Summary confirms the justification, prefers resources to be allocated toward the fishing industry. On the map, marine_life_deck, is situated around the blue region which is for fishing activity. The fuller context therefore suggests that Goldstein’s objection is location-specific rather than anti-tourism in principle, he resists placing a tourism facility in a predominant fishing zone."

    "text": "Key evidence missing from TROUT – case of Simone Kat\nIn the original TROUT‐only view Simone Kat looks entirely neutral: the heat-map shows 0.00 for both Tourism and Fishing, and the TROUT network offers no coloured arrows that would hint at her stance.\n\n\nOnce the FILAH and Journalist sources are added, three tourism-related messages appear, each positive, and one mildly negative fishing remark is revealed. These extra rows lift her Tourism mean to +0.89 and push her Fishing mean down to -0.18, flipping the overall judgement from “indifferent” to “tourism advocate who questions certain fishing practices”.\n\n\nScrolling the Activity-summary, every line for Simone shows red ✗ under TROUT while FILAH and JOURNALIST supply multiple positive tourism items such as:\n\n\n\n\nMissing evidence that changed the judgement\n\nheritage_walking_tour – a flagship cultural proposal to attract more visitors\nmarine_life_deck – major attraction for tourism\nseafood_festival - drawing in more tourism\naffordable_housing - conflicts with tourism-focused accommodations for short term rentals\n\n\nAnalysis\nWithout these, TROUT leaves Simone looking inactive. Including FILAH and Journalist flips the picture: she emerges as the board’s principal advocate for community-oriented tourism. The omission therefore materially understates her contribution and skews any assessment of board balance."

    "text": "Behaviour most distorted by sampling bias in FILAH - Ed Helpsford\nWith all three datasets ticked the sentiment heat-map reports Ed Helpsford as strongly positive toward both Fishing (+0·80) and Tourism (+0·50) in TROUT and the Journalist records, yet entirely blank in the FILAH column.\n\nThe network panels reinforce the gap: TROUT and Journalist show Ed at the hub of green arrows to topics such as affordable_housing, low_volume_crane and concert, whereas the FILAH pane collapses to No Data.\nSorting the Activity Summary by the FILAH column reveals twelve rows for Ed – ten tourism activities and eight fishing items – every one marked with a red ✗ under FILAH but green ✓ under at least one other source.\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis\nBecause FILAH contributes no records for him, any analyst who relied on that dataset alone would conclude that Ed is largely inactive. The full corpus shows the opposite: he is a leading participant in both tourism expansion (waterfront_market, concert) and fishing projects (low_volume_crane). Hence his behaviour is the most visibly skewed by FILAH’s sampling bias."

    "text": "Illustrating the bias in the FILAH data\n\nHeat-map contrast\nWhen only FILAH is ticked, the heat-map looks like this:\n\n\nEntire rows for Ed Helpsford, Tante Titan, Teddy Goldstein are blank, sentiments for Tourism and Fishing are both 0.00.\nRows for Simone Kat, Seal and Carol Limpet contain Tourism values, and in Simone’s case a mild negative for Fishing.\nThis pattern means FILAH captured some members and topics yet missed others completely, rather than suffering a general data loss.\n\nFull Corpus reveals:\n\n\nEd Helpsford’s cells turn deep blue, +0.50 for Tourism and +0.80 for Fishing.\nTeddy Goldstein gains +0.88 for Fishing, -0.50 for Tourism.\nThe contrast between blank and blue cells shows that FILAH suppressed the most active voices while recording moderate Tourism sentiment for a subset of members.\n\n\n\nNetwork panels – structural sparsity\n\nWith all datasets selected, compare the three side-by-side networks.\n\nFewer nodes. FILAH’s panel contains fewer person nodes. Ed Helpsford and Tante Titan are completely absent.\nLower edge density. TROUT and Journalist contain many intersecting green, red and grey arrows, while FILAH shows only a handful of links, leaving several topics with a single connection or isolated altogether.\nTopic imbalance. Most of the nodes that do appear in FILAH are orange tourism topics; comparatively few blue fishing topics are present, so the conversation captured by FILAH leans strongly toward tourism.\n\nTogether, the reduced node count, lighter connectivity and tourism-heavy mix illustrate how FILAH under-represents both participants and fishing discussions relative to the other two datasets.\n\n\nRow-level evidence (Activity Summary and Network Viz)\nFilter Member = Ed Helpsford with all datasets ticked.\nEvery one of his rows carries a red ✗ in the FILAH column yet a green ✓ in TROUT, Journalist or both, confirming that FILAH contributes zero of his statements (tourism and fishing).\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis\nFILAH is selective, not incomplete: it captures tourism sentiment for three board members while omitting every fishing interaction by those members and dropping three other members entirely. Analyses built solely on FILAH would therefore over-state tourism consensus, under-report fishing debate and misidentify the most active participants."

    "text": "Conclusion and Future Work\nThe integrated analysis of the COOTEFOO knowledge-graph datasets shows a consistent, statistically supported bias in favour of tourism over fishing. Across topics, datasets and individual board members, mean sentiment towards tourism is higher, a pattern confirmed by ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis, robust and Bayesian tests. The fishing‐favourable picture suggested by TROUT alone is not borne out once FILAH and the Journalist notes are added, illustrating the danger of drawing conclusions from incomplete evidence. Including all sources brings to light positive tourism statements, particularly for members such as Simone Kat and Seal, and exposes selective omissions in advocacy-group records. Visual checks, for example heatmaps and geo-linked network views, reinforce these statistical findings and demonstrate how data integration produces a more balanced understanding of committee dynamics.\nKey findings\n\nTourism sentiment dominates every comparative slice, by topic, by dataset and by member.\nThe tourism advantage is statistically significant under multiple confirmatory tests, whereas TROUT’s apparent fishing bias is not.\nData completeness matters: FILAH and Journalist records add positive tourism sentiment that TROUT omits, correcting the narrative.\nMember-level inspection reveals selective gaps, for example the absence of Ed Helpsford in FILAH, illustrating how sampling bias can distort personal profiles.\nMapping and sentiment heatmaps provide spatial and relational context, grounding numerical results in clear visual evidence.\n\nFuture work\n\nMachine-learning sentiment refinement. Train a gradient-boosted decision tree or transformer-based classifier on the raw text of meeting minutes to produce sentence-level sentiment scores, replacing manual averages with model-based probabilities."

    "text": "Background and Context\nOceanus, a small island nation, has historically relied on a robust fishing-based economy. In recent years, however, tourism has begun rapidly expanding, significantly reshaping local economic dynamics. To guide this complex transition responsibly, the government established the Commission on Overseeing the Economic Future of Oceanus (COOTEFOO). This appointed oversight board, while lacking direct legislative power, holds substantial influence and funding, entrusted to evaluate economic trends objectively and advise accordingly.\nCOOTEFOO’s role, however, has come under intense scrutiny. Two vocal advocacy groups have recently accused the board of deep-seated biases:\n\nFishing is Living and Heritage (FILAH) claims COOTEFOO is overly biased towards promoting tourism, neglecting the island’s historical economic foundation in fishing.\nConversely, Tourism Raises OceanUs Together (TROUT) argues COOTEFOO remains stubbornly loyal to fishing interests, effectively ignoring lucrative opportunities offered by tourism.\n\nIn response to these competing accusations, investigative journalist Edwina Darling Moray (E.D.) of the Haacklee Herald obtained the datasets provided by both FILAH and TROUT, containing detailed meeting minutes and travel records for COOTEFOO members. Moray also secured additional evidence beyond what either advocacy group had compiled. After initial data cleaning and knowledge-graph creation by a staff programmer, these datasets were prepared for analysis."

    "text": "Initial EDA\n\nThe Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) dashboard provides an overview of sentiment and activity coverage across three datasets (FILAH, TROUT, JOURNALIST) to identify potential biases and gaps in COOTEFOO’s discussions.\nFirstly, sentiment distributions (violin plots) show that TROUT leans positively towards tourism and has limited coverage of fishing, while FILAH presents wider sentiment variability in fishing. JOURNALIST provides a more balanced view, sitting between the two extremes.\nSecondly, the stacked bar chart highlights clear gaps: TROUT under-represents fishing sentiment, while FILAH lacks data on other industry categories, emphasising skewed coverage.\nThirdly, member activity bar charts reveal uneven representation, some members, like Simone Kat, appear frequently across all datasets, whereas others, like Seal and Teddy Goldstein, have sparse coverage in FILAH or TROUT.\nLastly, a sentiment coverage table explicitly summarises member representation across datasets, clearly illustrating individual-level gaps. Overall, the EDA reveals dataset-specific biases, justifying deeper interactive analysis in subsequent stages."

Sliding up to, say, “3” would remove topics discussed by fewer than three members, decluttering the graph.\n\n\n\nInsights and Links to Next Stage:\nThrough this visualisation, Moray explicitly identifies preliminary biases. Members notably skewed toward one industry become focal points in subsequent analyses. The biases identified here set expectations for travel patterns explored in Stage 2, allowing Moray to test whether members’ stated interests match their real-world actions."
