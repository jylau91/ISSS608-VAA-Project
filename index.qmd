## Project Brief

In Mini-Challenge 2 of the 2025 IEEE VAST Challenge, our team investigates potential biases in the Commission on Overseeing the Economic Future of Oceanus (COOTEFOO).

We integrate three knowledge graphs—TROUT, FILAH, and an independent journalist dataset—alongside two contextual layers:

-   **Geographic Basemap (Oceanus)**: Administrative boundaries provided as a GeoJSON file.
-   **Road Network**: Node-link graph depicting highways and local roads with true geographic coordinates.

Our goal is to develop interactive and static visual analytics that:

1.  Reveal community structures and central actors in COOTEFOO’s network.\
2.  Uncover spatial clustering of meetings, travel, and discussion events.\
3.  Assess if there are any thematic bias toward tourism or fishing interests.

This home page serves as the entry point to our analysis, code, and visualizations. Navigate through the tabs or sidebar to explore each our take on the project.

We hope this platform offers clear insights into government's accountability and fosters transparent decision-making. Enjoy exploring Oceanus through our lens!
